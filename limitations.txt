Current list of things that have not been handled -

1. If the user denies permission for switching discovery mode on
2. If the same device goes off discoverable mode and comes back on during scanning, gets added to list twice.
3. Make an onDestroy() by overriding, for unregistering the broadcast receivers in MainActivity.java
4. For checking duplicate devices discovered, brute force method is used. Optimize.
5. Status messages are not visible when trying to connect to devices.
6. Only one RFCOMM channel is supported, so connection occurs if only 2 devices exist in range (including self).
7. Device does not show up in discovery mode if previously paired (?)
