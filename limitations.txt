Current list of things that have not been handled -

1. If the user denies permission for switching discovery mode on
3. Make an onDestroy() by overriding, for unregistering the broadcast receivers in MainActivity.java
4. For checking duplicate devices discovered, brute force method is used. Optimize.
8. Have to manually grant location permission
9. Have to manually switch on location
10. Improve UI when scroll bar has to appear for messages

High Priority -
1. Add list of device hops to message JSON.
2. Message sometimes does not send for no apparent reason. Try ACK messages, and resending a few times.
3. Add encoding/decoding for previous versions of android as shown in TextInterface.java
