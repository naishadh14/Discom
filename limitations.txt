Current list of things that have not been handled -

1. If the user denies permission for switching discovery mode on
2. If the same device goes off discoverable mode and comes back on during scanning, gets added to list twice.
3. Make an onDestroy() by overriding, for unregistering the broadcast receivers in MainActivity.java
4. For checking duplicate devices discovered, brute force method is used. Optimize.
